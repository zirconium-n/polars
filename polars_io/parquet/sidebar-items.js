The sliceable cursor is similar to std::io::Cursor, except that it makes it easy to create “cursor slices”. To achieve this, it uses Arc instead of shared references. Indeed reference fields are painful because the lack of Generic Associated Type implies that you would require complex lifetime propagation when returning such a cursor."]]});
